During the Sprint, you will spend 4 hours in class meetings, 4 hours on your team project (2 of which during class), and 10 hours on your selected module. Make a plan for your 10 hours by answering the questions below. You should refer back to this plan and make adjustments during the Sprint.

1. What sources have you selected to learn the technical material?

Use the youtube video as a base for learning syntax and installing proper work enviromnent

3. What demonstration software do you plan on submitting at the end of the Sprint (note that this can and may change)?
   My portfollio page - Hopefully I can have that be my root page in github.

4. Identify the days, times, and locations that you will work on the module.
   Every day for at least 45 mins to 1 hour. At a private place that is not at home, mostly the library.

5. Identify both a technical risk and a behavioral risk that you antcipate may occur during this Sprint. What is your mitgigation plan?
   Going home and playing video games.

Getting caught up on other homework

Bad time management.

## Part 2 - Time Log

This section should be filled out during the Sprint.

Record all CSE 310 work that you do on your individual module or the team project. Include time learning, practicing, developing, testing, and documenting. Don't include time spent in the 4 class meetings (Planning, Stand-Up, Team Review, and Individual Review). You will need to sum of these hours at the end of the Sprint. Note that the hours you report will affect your grades.

4. If you completed a Stretch Challenge (as shown in the Module Description document in Canvas) then describe what you did. If you did the Choose Your Own Adventure module, then you get to decide what qualifies as a Stretch Challenge.
   I am not sure if I did to be honest, but I put a ton of time making sure that everything works for my website and I am very proud of it. The best part is that I am not done with it yet.

5. Did you change your selected module during the middle of the Sprint? If yes, then describe what you changed it to, when you changed it, and why you changed it.
   No

6. Using the log above, fill in the total hours and minutes you spent on the individual module:

| Activity          | Total Hours:Minutes |
| ----------------- | ------------------- |
| Individual Module | 7 hours 45 minutes  |

7. What strategies (behavioral and technical) worked well during this Sprint? What did not work well? List some possible ways that you can improve next Sprint.
The best thing about this was that the work enviromment was working. I needed to install more things along the way but working on the project worked smoothly. In terms of things that I needed to work on making the styles work is the most concernthing thing about the project so far.
